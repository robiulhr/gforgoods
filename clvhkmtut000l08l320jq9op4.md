Mold and dust are ubiquitous elements mostly found in indoor environments. Often we overlook these particles but these particles can affect badly to both our health and hygiene and make us ill.

Mold is one kind of fungus that thrives in damp, humid environments. It reproduces by releasing tiny spores into the air, which can easily become airborne and spread throughout the home. it is guaranteed to be present in every house.

on the other hand, Dust is a mixture of fine particles that accumulate from various sources, including outdoor pollutants, human and pet dander, pollen, and soil.

Both mold and dust play significant roles in polluting our indoor air quality and these particles are the enemy of all those suffering from breathing problems.

However, this mold and dust problem does have a solution and that is an air purifier. Air purifiers can filter the air from mold and dust particles and provide fresher air to breathe.

But choosing the right purifier is a big challenge. There are a number of options in the market which makes it difficult to choose the best one.

In this article, I will share some air purifiers that are best in the current market judging their filtration systems, budget, Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR), noise level, and some other important things.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing an Air Purifier

Before choosing an air purifier there are some key things that need to be checked to ensure effectiveness and suitability for your specific needs.

1. Filtration System:
    

* HEPA Filters: HEPA filters are the most important component of a purifier that must be present in a purifier to purify the air. The Hepa filter removes 99.97% of particles &gt; 0.3 microns. That means for every 10,000 particles that is contained within a particular quantity of air that comes through this air purifier only 3 particles out of that 10,000 are going to make it through the filter are going to make it pass the filter up and out of the filter.
    

> Note: mold is larger particles it can be anywhere to 2 to 40 microns in diameter. That is very large in the world of air purifying. Molds are large enough can really be filtered with any kind of particle filter.
> 
> For most of the other particles, we recommend a HEPA filter However because mold particles are so large we can use any kind of particle filter at all. You don't have to look for anything special for the air purifier filter if your primary concern is mold.
> 
> Now definitely we still prefer units that are equipped with HEPA filters because air contains much more than mold. Even if you have a mold issue there are still other particles that need to be taken care of and the HEPA filter will do much better with those other particles than other particle filter out there.

* Activated Carbon Filters: In addition to HEPA filtration, consider air purifiers that feature activated carbon filters to absorb odors and VOCs, providing comprehensive air purification and a fresher indoor environment.
    

2. Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR): CADR basically refers to the purifier's efficiency in removing airborne particles from the air. There are no fixed CADR ratings for mold and dust removal. It depends on room size and pollutant levels. At first, you need to Consider the room size or space where the air purifier will be used. Larger rooms will require air purifiers with higher CADR ratings and greater airflow capacity to achieve efficient air cleaning.
    
3. Additional Features:
    
    * Air Quality Sensors: Air purifiers with built-in air quality sensors can automatically adjust fan speed based on detected pollution levels, optimizing performance and energy efficiency.
        
    * Programmable Timers and Sleep Modes: Convenient features like programmable timers and sleep modes allow for customized operation and quieter operation during nighttime use.
        
    * Noise Levels and Energy Efficiency: Consider noise levels and energy consumption when selecting an air purifier, especially for use in bedrooms or other quiet spaces. Look for energy-efficient models with low noise levels for optimal comfort and convenience.
        
    * Ease of Maintenance: Choose air purifiers with easy-to-replace filters and straightforward maintenance requirements to ensure hassle-free operation and long-term effectiveness.
        

By considering these factors and selecting an air purifier tailored to your specific needs, you can enjoy the numerous benefits of cleaner indoor air and improved respiratory health.

## Winix 5300-2 Air Purifier with True HEPA Filter

![Winix 5300-2 Air Purifier with True HEPA Filter](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1714189664439/c5c4bc03-0f99-4c47-9295-44ce5966cef4.webp align="center")

Winix 4-stage True HEPA Air purifier is one of the best HEPA-equipped air purifier on the current market. It moves a lot of air and is almost silent. I think this machine is the best value for money on Amazon for air purifiers. This purifier is equipped with a washable pre-filter and a true HEPA filter.

The pre-filter is there to take care of larger particles and in this scenario it is actually going to filter out a lot of mold spores themselves right there on the washable pre-filter. Also since this pre-filter is washable you can wash it when it gets dirty and re place it without spending money for a new one which is a great benefit.

It has an activated carbon filter and a True HEPA filter inside the Air purifier. The quality of True Hepa filter is really good and it's even comparable to much higher price air purifiers.

This machine is a bigger one and has a lot of surface area compared to other units and that is why the fan can be larger and draw more air in at a lower speed. This purifier is perfectly fine for large spaces like living rooms and offices because it's powerful enough and can clean rooms up to 360 square feet in one hour. Plus, the remote makes it very easy to control the speed from a distance.

The Winix has 5 speed modes, Sleep, Low, Med, High, and Turbo. It is as quiet as If you are a light sleeper, you won't get disturbed by its noise. It is almost dead silent in sleep mode and is not a problem even at Med level - after that, it sounds like a little fan in your room and if you put this into turbo mode it sounds like a small aircraft - you don't need to be tensed of it because it's good for initial cleanup but mostly you won't run it at that speed all day.

It's not like it will replace vacuuming your house or brushing your cats. There are dedicated machines for pet hair, but this machine is not made for this purpose. This machine is specially designed to remove particles from the air and it cleans the air as advertised. It doesn't spread strange smells, except the smell of a fresh air filter. It's well-built, and the buttons look and feel very good.

This purifier comes with an Ionizer which is also called Plasmawave. The Ionizer charges any kind of particles passing through the purifier so they get heavier and will float to the ground and out of air. If you're concerned about Ozone gasses, you can disable this feature at any time.

The Winix looks very clean and modern, and the black color blends well into a corner near the furniture.

### Bad things about this

The LED lights of this purifier are pretty bright, which may be problematic at night.

## BLUEAIR Air Purifier Blue 211+

![BLUEAIR Air Purifier Blue 211+](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1714189641012/34098950-59b1-474d-8872-935185b466c8.webp align="center")

The Blueair Blue Pure 211+ unit is an attractive and simple one. It doesn't look like any weird '90s appliance or gadget with a bunch of random protuberances or shiny stickers. It is very clean and smart looking and would integrate with a lot of decor.

The changeable pre-filters come with a light blue and a midnight blue color, and you can buy others if you want. These pre-filters are washable. This purifier Looks fine without it as well, pure white.

I find the size to be good. It’s not really enormous, as some large room purifiers are, but it will take up more floor space than the Winix 5500-2 (but it isn’t as tall).

This purifier pulls air from all 4 sides, so you can’t stick this purifier right up against a wall if you want the best performance. The clean air comes out of the top of the purifier.

As for the sound, the Blueair’s sound is noticeable, but it is very even and is decent white noise at top speed. You won't have a problem falling asleep near it. At the lowest speed for you’ll have a hard time hearing it at this level unless the room is really quiet.

The Blueair really moves air well. At top speed, you can feel the air moving in all parts of the room. It will make the room feel a bit cooler.

The Blueair is not very heavy and it is easy to move (though you may want to move the two halves separately if you find it awkward).

The unit is made mostly of plastic, which makes it lighter and easier to move, but there is a bad side to it. If your kid sits on this purifier, it will break.

There’s one button. Touch to change between off -&gt; low -&gt; med -&gt; high -&gt; off. It is sensitive and easy to use. The top rim of the button lights up with a bright white light which lets you know the fan speed.

There is no automatic mode in this purifier. Though It’s not a deal breaker, many people do appreciate the feature so one can save money but still have very clean air.

The Blueair does not have a remote control as the Winix 5500-2 has. The cost of replacing the filter seems about the same as other popular air filters out there and they offer a wide variety of colors for the external filter.

In short, it has almost everything people want from a purifier - a quiet fan, a large filter area, easy buttons, and more. All in all, an easy recommendation if the filtration capacity meets your needs.

### Bad things about this

The power cord is attached to the back of the purifier, so if you break it by mistake or a pet chews the cord, the whole unit will have to be replaced.

## LEVOIT Core 400S/ Core 400S-P Smart Air Purifier

![LEVOIT Core 400S/ Core 400S-P Smart Air Purifier](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1714189616122/49a18647-fa22-42fb-b2c7-3c5052262f87.webp align="center")

This air purifier is designed for large rooms up to 1980 square feet. The three-stage HEPA filtration system removes 99% of impurities. In addition, this filter is designed to last up to six months before needing to be replaced. However, you have to still clean the pre-filter every 2 to 4 weeks.

The Levoit features a five-speed fan. You can manually set the fan speed or let the purifier set it automatically based on the room's air quality. When the purifier is set to Auto Mode, the fan speeds up when it recognizes allergens or other pollutants in the air and then returns to the lower setting mode once the air is clean.

It is almost soundless in sleep mode and at fan speed 1. Unless you're right next to it, it is barely noticeable at fan speed 2, when you are in the same room it is noticeable at fan speed 3 but not obnoxious. It is Noticeably louder when the fan speed is 4 which should be considered a 'Turbo" mode.

It has some smart features including the app and Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant compatibility. Using the app You can control it from your phone. The app is very user-friendly and amusingly easy to set up.

The app is so useful that you can set the timer to it, control it from anywhere in the world, or set it to turn on and clean the air right before you come home. Also In the app, you can see the current air quality in the room and get filter replacement notifications.

It has a nice and clean look and has a small footprint. It is very well-built yet lightweight and easy to move from one place to another. The price is worth it if you plan to use this in a larger space like a drawing room or office area and want the ability to control it hands-free or while you're away from your home.

The purifier would also automatically kick on when you fry food in the house or stir-fried anything on a skillet.

Levoit's Wi-fi capabilities plus the app can make such a big difference in convenience and scheduled cleanings. And the auto sensors do work well.

### Bad things about this

The pre-filter of this purifier requires regular maintenance and cleaning every 2 to 4 weeks. The bottom of this purifier comes off sometimes when moving it around. The app does not always update the air purifier immediately which is not a big deal for most people.
